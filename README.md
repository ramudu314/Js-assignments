payload ?

In web development, "payload" typically refers to the data that is being sent from one point to another, often in the context of HTTP requests. In the provided code snippet, the payload refers to the data collected from the form fields (name, email, standard) that needs to be sent to the server for processing or storage.

Here's a breakdown of the payload construction in the code:

javascript
Copy code
const payload = {
  name: name,
  email: email,
  standard: standard,
};
name, email, and standard are variables that hold the values extracted from the respective form fields.
These values are organized into an object named payload, where each key represents a field name (such as "name", "email", "standard"), and each corresponding value represents the user input for that field.
This payload object is then typically serialized into JSON format using JSON.stringify(payload). JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a common format for exchanging data between a client and a server.
So, essentially, the payload is a structured set of data representing the form input, which will be sent to the server via an HTTP request (in this case, a POST request to utkarsh.com).
